### Welcome to Brackets Themes

Brackets Themes is made up of a group of Brackets Theme Extension authors who publish their themes as a team under the same banner.

One of the goals of Brackets Themes is to produce high-quality themes that you can be sure are compliant to the latest standards as set out by the Brackets core dev team and that the themes here will be updated as the standards evolve over time.
